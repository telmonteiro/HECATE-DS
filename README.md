# HECATE-DS -- HarvEsting loCAl specTra with Exoplanets (Doppler Shadow)

Hecate is a goddess in ancient Greek religion and mythology, most often shown holding a pair of torches, a key, or snakes, or accompanied by dogs, and in later periods depicted as three-formed or triple-bodied. Hecate is often associated with illuminating what is hidden and find your way in cross-roads.

HECATE is a modular and easy to use Python to tool to perform the Doppler Shadow technique, in order to unveil the properties of local stellar spectra, by using transiting exoplanets as probes.

Under active development.
