HECATE-DS
=================================

Hecate is a goddess in ancient Greek religion and mythology, most often shown holding a pair of torches, a key, or snakes, or accompanied by dogs, and in later periods depicted as three-formed or triple-bodied. Hecate is often associated with illuminating what is hidden and find your way in cross-roads.

HECATE (HarvEsting loCAl specTra with Exoplanets - Doppler Shadow) is a modular and easy to use Python to tool to perform the Doppler Shadow technique, in order to unveil the properties of local stellar spectra, by using transiting exoplanets as probes.
